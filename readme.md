# O'Connell labware

Done something useful and wish to share it with your future self, or others?

*If you have write access (I believe everyone does)*:
- `git clone https://github.com/bede/labware.git`
- Create a readme.md markdown file inside a sensibly named directory
- `git add useful-thing/`
- `git commit -m "Incredibly useful thing"`
- Finally, `git push origin master`
